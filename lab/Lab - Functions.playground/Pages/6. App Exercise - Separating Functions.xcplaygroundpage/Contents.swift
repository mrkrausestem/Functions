 ## Separating Functions
 > These exercises should return a value and print the result OUTSIDE of the functions
 
 One principle that can help in debugging and maintaining code is abstraction. For example, if you are creating an app to calculate the surface area of specific geometric figures, it would be easier to decompose the calculations into smaller functions with specific purposes that to group them all together into 1 big function.

/*:
  - Steps
    1. Copy your areaOfRectangle function from page 5.
    2. Create a function called `calcSAofRectangularPrism` that takes 3 parameters `height`,`width` and `length`. This function should return a double.
    3. **Call your area function to find the area of the sides of the prism** (no shortcuts!!)
    4. Implement the proper calculations to finish up the surface area calculation and return the result
    5. Print the result
 
*/

/*: Now create a function to calculate the surface area of a triangular prism. Copy and use your triangle area function from the previous page. Make sure you print the result. (1 points)
