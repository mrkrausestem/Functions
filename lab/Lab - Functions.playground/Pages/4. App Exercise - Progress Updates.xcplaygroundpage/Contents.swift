 ## App Exercise - Progress Updates
 
 In many cases you want to provide input to a function. For example, the report grade function you wrote page 2 might be located in an area of your project that doesn't have access to the value of `correctQuestions` and `totalQuestions`. In that case, whenever you called the function, you would need to provide it with that information so it can print the correct grade.
 
 Rewrite the function `reportGrade`, only this time give it two parameters of type `Int` called `totalQuestions` and `correctQuestions`, respectively. It should work exactly the same way as before using the values passed. Call the function and observe the printout.
 
 **Call the function a number of times**, passing in different values of `totalQuestions` and `correctQuestions`. Observe the printouts and make sure what is printed to the console is what you would expect for the parameters passed in. (1 point)

/*:
 Your app is going to have to keep track of cumulative grades as well. Write a function called calcCumulativeAvg that takes three parameters: `currentAverage`, `numOfGrades`, and `newGrade`. This function should calculate the students new cumulative average and check to see if they are still passing (above 70%), if they are print "Keep it up!" otherwise, print "You need to study harder!" Try your function with several combinations to make sure it is working correctly. (1 point)
