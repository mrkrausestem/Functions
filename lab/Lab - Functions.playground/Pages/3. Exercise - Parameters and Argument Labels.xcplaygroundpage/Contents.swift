 > These exercises requires different treaments of the labels. Make sure that you pay attention!
 
 Write a new introduction function called `introduction`. It should take two `String` parameters, `name` and `home`, and one `Int` parameter, `age`. The function should print a brief introduction. I.e. if "Mary," "California," and 32 were passed into the function, it might print "Mary, 32, is from California." Call the function and observe the printout. (.25 points)

/*:
 Write a function called `almostAddition` that takes two `Int` arguments. The first argument should **not** require an argument label. The function should add the two arguments together, subtract 2, then print the result. Call the function and observe the printout. (.5 points)

/*:
 Write a function called `multiply` that takes two `Double` arguments. The function should multiply the two arguments and print the result. The first argument should not require a label, and the second argument should have an external label, "by", that differs from the internal label. Call the function and observe the printout.
