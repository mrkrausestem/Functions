# Functions

The reading for this is found on pages 155 - 164.  Please make sure that you know how to create a subroutine vs. a function.
Although those two things are treated very similar in SWIFT, a subroutine does NOT return a value where a function does.  
In other programming languages, they are treated differently, but the concept remains the same.

Do the review questions on pg 164, then do the lab.
